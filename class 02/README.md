Arrays and 'or' function in console.log

- Basic HTML set up 
- h1 tag, button, and paragraph 
- button has an event listener and handler on it
- variable called "studentsinclass" = [];//[] this is an array?
- function, variation is 'newstudent' equalling a prompt which asks 'Enter new name?'
- studentsintheclass.push(newStudent) - which adds a new student to the list.
- List appears in console.log
- if function folllows with an 'or' which is || and options in quotation marks
- be consistent with quotation marks.

- Button with event listener and handler 
- <p> is given ID. 
- Script opens 
- Function clicking (), prompt is built in to ask 'guess the number' which we have inputted as a = 10
- If function == which means it's comparing and it's asking is it equal to 
- docunment.getElementId(x).innerHTML = "quote"
- If a is correctly guessed then HTML changes to "yes you are", if not it changes to "nope".

  Part 2 - guessing game without limit on number of goes.
- If function guessed number 'guessnumber' is == to a then in the alert you will get an answer
