# Data Types in Terminal 
- Data types include numeric, string"", boolean, function, object
- To JavaScript, everthing is an object
- console.log(typeof()); tells us in the terminal, what type of data it is.

# Getters and setters
- button with event listener and event handler 
- Script opens
- Set variable as secret number which in this case is equal to 20
- **A getter will retrieve the number through console.log**
- **A setter will mean a new number in inputted, changing the number**
- Function getsecretnumber (is what we labelled it) {// gets the secret number console.log(secretnumnber)}
- Function setssecretnumebr (is whatr we labelled it) {// sets the secret number console.log("set the secret number");
- **in quotation marks because someone is inputting the data**
